# Endless CAPTCHA
An endless CAPTCHA designed to waste scammers' time. Scambaiters can use this on their fake Bitcoin websites. This fake CAPTCHA is similar to most image-based CAPTCHAs, but it never ends. You need to wait 20 seconds between each cycle, so it's sure to waste scammers' time.\
Everything is in a single `.html` file, including the CSS and JavaScript. You don't need to provide images, but if you want to you can modify the code and make it use locally stored images.

Scambaiters, feel free to use this on your fake "receive Bitcoin" websites. This program is available under the MIT license, so anyone can use it. You can credit me if you want to, but this is not required and I'm perfectly fine with it if you don't.\
The text in the bottom-right corner that says `© 2025 Botfighters Inc.` is purely decorational and has nothing to do with the rights to this program. It's only there to help trick scammers into thinking it's real.
